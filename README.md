    <h1>Math-Educ Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>
        "KUSA DEV has created the applications Math-Educ and MathEXO as advertising-funded applications. This SERVICE is provided free of charge by KUSA DEV and is intended to be used as is.

This page is used to inform visitors of my policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information if anyone decides to use my service.</p>

If you choose to use my service, you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The personal information I collect is used to provide and improve the service. I will not use or share your information with anyone except in the cases described in this privacy policy.

The terms used in this privacy policy have the same meaning as in our terms and conditions, unless otherwise stated in this privacy policy."
   

 <h2>Collection and use of information</h2>
<p>For a better experience, while using our Service, I may ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information, including but not limited to Advertising ID, User Address login and information about registered applications. The information I request will be stored on your device and will not be collected by me in any way.
My applications use third-party services that may collect information used to identify you (Facebook Audience Network ads).

 <h2>Security</h2>
<p>I appreciate your trust in providing us with your personal information, which is why we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect it. But remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>



<h2>Children's privacy</h2>
<p>These services are not intended for people under 13 years of age. I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13, as the service is not available to those under the age of 13. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact me so that I can take necessary steps.
