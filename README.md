 <h2>Security</h2>
<p>I appreciate your trust in providing us with your personal information, which is why we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect it. But remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>



<h2>Children's privacy</h2>
<p>These services are not intended for people under 13 years of age. I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13, as the service is not available to those under the age of 13. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact me so that I can take necessary steps.
